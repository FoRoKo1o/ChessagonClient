# HEXAGON - Hexagonal Chess Game

## Overview

This project is a hexagonal chess game built for the web. The game implements classic chess logic adapted to a hexagonal board, allowing for unique movement dynamics compared to the traditional square board. The game is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it offers players the opportunity to explore how chess pieces move and interact in a hexagonal setting. Inspiration form [

## Piece Movement

Each pieceâ€™s movement is adapted to the hexagonal layout:

### Pawn
Moves forward one step, with optional diagonal attacks. Special movement rules apply for the first move, allowing a two-step forward move.

  </p>

When a pawn reaches the last row of the opponent's side, a modal appears for the player to choose a new piece (e.g., queen, rook, bishop, or knight) to replace the pawn.
